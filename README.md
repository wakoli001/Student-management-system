# Student Record Management System (C)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Student Record Management System** is a console-based application written in **C** that allows users to store, retrieve, and search student records using **file handling**.  
The project demonstrates practical use of **structures, pointers, functions, and binary files** in C programming.

This project was built as part of my learning journey in **C programming**, with a focus on mastering **pointers and file operations**.
